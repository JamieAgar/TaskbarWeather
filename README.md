## Favourites

![](Images/App_Screenshot_2.png)

TaskbarWeather allows the user to save 3 locations to their "favourites", so that they may click on the associated box instead of typing the location in. When the user adds a favourite, the first letter of the location will be displayed in the box. 

These favourites are saved to a file on the user's local system, and are automatically saved and loaded upon creating a new favourite, or opening the application.

## How To Search
Users may search for for a location using the city name, or if necessary they can also append the state and/or country to the search. 

## Adapting the application
